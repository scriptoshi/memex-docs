# Launchpad Economics

### Overview

The launchpad provides a fair and secure token launch mechanism with three distinct phases: Pre-bonding, Bonding, and Finalized. It incorporates protective measures like LP locking and controlled price discovery to create a sustainable token economy.

### Key Features

* Three-phase launch process
* Guaranteed lowest entry price for early supporters
* 10-year LP token lock
* AMM-based price discovery
* Fee collection mechanisms for platform sustainability
* Protected launch with anti-rug pull measures

### Launch Phases

#### 1. Pre-bonding Phase

This is the initial and most advantageous entry point for token purchases.&#x20;

**Key Characteristics:**

* Lowest possible token price
* Target is 20% of virtualEth settings.
* Tokens are locked until project finalization
* All purchases at fixed initial price
* Creates core group of committed holders
* Ideal entry point for team and early supporters
* Guarantees fixed LP base for token

**Important Note:** Once pre-bonding ends, token price automatically increases by 20%.

#### 2. Bonding Phase

Active trading phase with dynamic pricing.

**Features:**

* Open buying and selling
* Price determined by AMM constant product formula
* Price increases with purchases
* Price decreases with sales
* Sell fees apply to discourage early dumping
* Fees collected go to platform admin address

#### 3. Finalized Phase

Project migration to Uniswap V3.

**Process:**

* Can be Finalized by any one after bonding target reached
* Creates Uniswap V3 pool
* Adds initial liquidity
* Locks LP NFT for 10 years
* Enables fee collection for project owner

### Price Mechanics

* Pre-bonding: Fixed initial price
* Bonding & After: AMM constant product formula
  * Price = (ETH Reserve ร Virtual ETH) รท Token Reserve
  * Buying increases price
  * Selling decreases price

### Fee Structure

1. **Sell Fees:**
   * Applied during bonding phase
   * Sent to platform admin address
   * Cannot be modified after deployment
   * Helps prevent price manipulation
2. **Trading Fees:**
   * Generated from Uniswap V3 pool after finalization
   * Collected by project owner
   * Continuous revenue stream for project maintenance

### LP Token Locking

* Duration: 10 years
* NFT owned by project creator
* Prevents liquidity removal ("rug pulls")
* Allows fee collection by owner
* Ensures long-term project stability

### Security Features

* LP tokens locked for 10 years
* Pre-bonding locks prevent early dumps
* Sell fees discourage manipulation
* Automated price discovery
* Transparent fee collection
* Immutable platform admin address
